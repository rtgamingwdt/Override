# Override
I have decided that I want to override some of the default pocketmine commands so that I can code them the way I want them for my own server. You can use this for your server if you want as well. But you might have to recode some things...

>Edited Commands

**/ban**

**/ban-ip**

**/banlist**

**/defaultgamemode**

**/deop**

**/say**

>Created Commands

**/clear**

>Events

**PlayerLoginEvent** (You might need to edit the code. It will currently tell people to go to our Discord Server.)
