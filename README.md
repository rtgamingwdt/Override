# Override
I have decided that I want to override some of the default pocketmine commands so that I can code them the way I want them. You can use this for your server if you want as well.

I have not been able to get on Minecraft yet to test some of these. However, I do know some that work in the console. And some will work in game and in console so those have no bugs. The following default commands have been recoded.

>Edited Commands

**/ban**

**/ban-ip** (Works in console. I have no idea if it works in game yet.)

**/banlist**

**/say**

>Created Commands

**/clear**

>Events

**PlayerLoginEvent** (You might need to edit the code. It will currently tell people to go to our Discord Server.)
