# Override
I have decided that I want to override some of the default pocketmine commands so that I can code them the way I want them. You can use this for your server if you want as well.

The following default commands have been recoded.

> /ban (Works in console. I have no idea if it works ingame yet.)

> /ban-ip (Some bugs that need fixing.)
